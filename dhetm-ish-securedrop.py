from https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/issues/55#issuecomment-2454681466
From a high level perspective: the sender encrypts its public DH share 
g^a using an asymmetric encryption scheme under the receiver's public key 
pk(sk_B). This way, the sender's identity g^a is not revealed unless the
adversary has access to sk_B.
Because the receiver's identity also needs to be kept secret, the PKE scheme
needs to provide anonymous encryption (i.e., the ciphertext doesn't
reveal the used public key).
