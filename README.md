## What is this?

This is a manual fork of
<https://gist.github.com/cfm/dab18074b9cecb06cbd006e1ab7ede7f> plus a KEM.  The
goal to keep this in sync on top of
<https://gist.github.com/cfm/dab18074b9cecb06cbd006e1ab7ede7f> so that a diff
shows *only* KEM-related changes.

```sh-session
$ git clone git@gist.github.com:09f4e5682d3b216762cd878e3a8879f0.git dhetm-kem-securedrop
$ cd dhetm-kem-securedrop/
$ git remote add upstream git@gist.github.com:dab18074b9cecb06cbd006e1ab7ede7f.git
$ git fetch upstream
$ git diff upstream/main
```


## What are we trying to do?

Out of the IETF's Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG), ["Combiner Functions for
Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanisms"][draft-ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners] tells
us that

> [t]he need for a KEM combiner function arises in three different contexts
> within IETF security protocols:  (1) [...]; (2) Post-quantum / traditional
> hybrid KEMs where output of a post-quantum KEM is combined with the output of
> a classical key transport or key exchange algorithm.  [...][^1]

The Post-Quantum Use in Protocols Working Group (PQUIP)'s ["Terminology for
Post-Quantum Traditional Hybrid
Schemes"][draft-ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology] gives us the relevant
definitions:

> **Post-Quantum Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrid Scheme:**  A multi-algorithm scheme
> where at least one component algorithm is a post-quantum algorithm and at
> least one is a traditional algorithm.[^2]
>
> **PQ/T Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM):**  A multi-algorithm KEM
> made up of two or more component algorithms where at least one is a
> post-quantum algorithm and at least one is a traditional algorithm. The
> component algorithms could be KEMs, or other key establishment
> algorithms.[^3]

This is important.  We are not merely *adding* a KEM *to* DHETM (a non-KEM key
exchange).  We are effectively transforming DHETM *into* a KEM.

And then "Combiner Functions" gives us the general principle of what we're
doing here:

> A KEM combiner is a function that takes in two or more shared secrets `ss_i`
> and returns a combined shared secret `ss`.
>
>     ss = kemCombiner(ss_1, ss_2, ..., ss_n)
>
> This document assumes that shared secrets are the output of a KEM, but
> without loss of generality they MAY also be any other source of cryptographic
> key material [...].[^4]

In our case, we'll have something like:

```python
ss_1 = DH(...)
ss_2 = DH(...)
ss_3, ct = Encap()  # ct to be dealt with separately
ss = kemCombiner(ss_1, ss_2, ss_3)
```
