# Next-Gen SecureDrop Research

## Highlights
 * All messages are equal
 * There are no accounts
 * Everything is end to end encrypted with one time symmetric keys
 * Source to journalist key agreement has forward secrecy
 * Zero explicit metadata on the server; there is implicit metadata, such as API access patterns
 * Key isolation: each key is used only for a cryptographic purpose: signing, encryption, message fetching

## Why is this unique?
What is implemented here is a small-scale, self-contained, anonymous message box, where anonymous parties (sources) can contact and receive replies from trusted parties (journalists). The whole protocol does not require server authentication, and every API call is independent and self-contained. Message submission and retrieval are completely symmetric for both sources and journalists, making the individual HTTP requests potentially indistinguishable. The server does not have information about message senders, receivers, the number of sources or login times, because there are no accounts, and therefore, no logins.

Nonetheless, the server must not reveal information about its internal state to external parties (such as generic internet users or sources), and must not allow those parties to enumerate or discern any information about messages stored on the server. To satisfy this constraint, a special message-fetching mechanism is implemented, where only the intended recipients are able to discover if they have pending messages.

## Security
For an informal threat model and comparison with other schemes, see the [related wiki page](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-poc/wiki/Proposals-comparison).

## Config
In `commons.py` there are the following configuration values which are global for all components, even though not all parties need all of them.

| Variable | Value | Components | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SERVER` | `127.0.0.1:5000` | source, journalist | The URL the Flask server listens on; used by both the journalist and the source clients. |
| `DIR` | `keys/` | server, source, journalist | The folder where everybody will load the keys from. There is no separation for demo simplicity but in an actual implementation everybody will only have their keys and the required public one to ensure the trust chain. |
| `UPLOADS` | `files/` | server | The folder where the Flask server will store uploaded files
| `JOURNALISTS` | `10` | server, source |  How many journalists do we create and enroll. In general, this is realistic, in current SecureDrop usage it is way less. For demo purposes everybody knows it, in a real scenario it would not be needed. |
| `ONETIMEKEYS` | `30` | journalist | How many ephemeral keys each journalist create, sign and uploads when required. |
| `CURVE` | `NIST384p` | server, source, journalist | The curve for all elliptic curve operations. It must be imported first from the python-ecdsa library. |
| `MAX_MESSAGES` | `500` | server | How may potential messages the server sends to each party when they try to fetch messages. This basically must be more than the messages in the database, otherwise we need to develop a mechanism to group messages adding some bits of metadata. |
| `CHUNK` | `512 * 1024` | source | The base size of every parts in which attachment are split/padded to. This is not the actual size on disk, cause that will be a bit more depending on the nacl SecretBox implementation. |

## Installation (Qubes)
Install dependencies and create the virtual environment.
```
sudo dnf install redis
sudo systemctl start redis
python3 -m virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate the FPF root key, the intermediate key, and the journalists long term keys and sign them all hierarchically.
```
python3 pki.py
```

Run the server:
```
FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask --app server run
```

Impersonate the journalists and generate ephemeral keys for each of them. Upload all the public keys and their signature to the server.
```
for i in $(seq 0 9); do python3 journalist.py -j $i -a upload_keys; done;
```

Call/caller charts can be generated with `make docs`.

## Demo

```
bash demo.sh
```

The demo script will clean past keys and files, flush Redis, generate a new PKI, start the server, generate and upload journalists and simulate submissions and replies from different sources/journalists.

## Parties
  * **Source(s)**: A source is someone who wants to share information. A source is considered unknown prior to their first contact. A source may want to send a text message and/or add attachments, and may want to return at a later time to read replies. The source's safety, and their ability to preserve their anonymity, are vital; the higher the degree of plausible deniability a source has, the better. No on-device persistence shall be required for a source to interact with the system; they should be able to conduct all communications using only a single, theoretically-memorizable passphrase. The source uses Tor Browser to preserve their anonymity.
  * **Journalist(s)**: Journalists are those designated to receive, triage, and reply to submissions from sources. Journalists are not anonymous, and the newsroom they work for is a discoverable public entity. Journalists are expected to access SecureDrop via a dedicated client, which has persistent encrypted storage.
  * **Newsroom**: A newsroom is the entity with formal ownership of a SecureDrop instance. The newsroom is a known public entity, and is expected to publish information on how to reach their SecureDrop instance via verified channels (website, social media, print). In the traditional model, newsrooms are also responsible for their own server administration and journalist enrollment.
  * **FPF**: Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) is the entity responsible for maintaining SecureDrop. FPF can offer additional services, such as dedicated support. While the project is open source, its components (SecureDrop releases, Onion Rulesets submitted upstream to Tor Browser) are signed with signing keys controlled by FPF. Despite this, SecureDrop is and will remain completely usable without any FPF involvement or knowledge.

## Notes on other components
  * **Keys**: When referring to keys, either symmetric or asymmetric, depending on the context, the key storage back-end (ie: the media device) may eventually vary. Especially long term keys can be stored on Hardware Security Modules or Smart Cards, and signing keys might also be a combination of multiple keys with special requirements (ie: 3 out of 5 signers)
  * **Server**: For this project a server might be a physical dedicated server housed in a trusted location, a physical server in an untrusted location, or a virtual server in a trusted or untrusted context. Besides the initial setup, all the connection to the server have to happen though the Tor Hidden Service Protocol. However, we can expect that a powerful attacker can find the server location and provider (through financial records, legal orders, de-anonymization attacks, logs of the setup phase).
  * **Trust(ed) parties**: When referring to "trust" and "trusted" parties, the term "trust" is meant in a technical sense (as used in https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-133r2.pdf), and not the social sense (as used in https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/news-habits-media/media-society/media-attitudes/trust-in-media/).

## Messaging protocol overview
Only a source can initiate a conversation; there are no other choices as sources are effectively unknown until they initiate contact first.

See the ["Flow Chart"](#flow-chart) section for a summary of the asymmetry in this protocol.

### Source submission to Journalist
The following procedure if performed by a Source that wants to send a message to all Journalists in a Newsroom with attachmnets. Technically, the possibility to contact just a single or a subset of journalists is possible. Whether to allow a source to choose or stick to a specific default is currently undefined.

 1. *Source* fetches *NR<sub>PK</sub>*, *sig<sup>FPF</sup>(NR<sub>PK</sub>)*
 2. *Source* checks *Verify(FPF<sub>PK</sub>,sig<sup>FPF</sup>(NR<sub>PK</sub>)) == true*, since FPF<sub>PK</sub> is pinned in the Source client
 3. For every *Journalist* (i) in *Newsroom*
     - *Source* fetches *<sup>i</sup>J<sub>PK</sub>*, *<sup>i</sup>sig<sup>NR</sup>(<sup>i</sup>J<sub>PK</sub>)*, *<sup>i</sup>JC<sub>PK</sub>*, *<sup>i</sup>sig<sup>iJ</sup>(<sup>i</sup>JC<sub>PK</sub>)*
     - *Source* checks *Verify(NR<sub>PK</sub>,<sup>i</sup>sig<sup>NR</sup>(<sup>i</sup>J<sub>PK</sub>)) == true*
     - *Source* checks *Verify(<sup>i</sup>J<sub>PK</sub>,<sup>i</sup>sig<sup>iJ</sup>(<sup>i</sup>JC<sub>PK</sub>)) == true*
     - *Source* fetches *<sup>ik</sup>JE<sub>PK</sub>*, *<sup>ik</sup>sig<sup>iJ</sup>(<sup>ik</sup>JE<sub>PK</sub>)* (k is random from the pool of non-used, non-expired, *Journalist* ephemeral keys)
     - *Source* checks *Verify(<sup>i</sup>J<sub>PK</sub>,<sup>ik</sup>sig<sup>iJ</sup>(<sup>ik</sup>JE<sub>PK</sub>)) == true*
 4. *Source* generates the unique passphrase randomly *PW = G()* (the only state that identifies the specific *Source*)
 5. *Source* derives *S<sub>SK</sub> = G(KDF(encryption_salt + PW))*, *S<sub>PK</sub> = GetPub(S<sub>SK</sub>)*
 6. *Source* derives *SC<sub>SK</sub> = G(KDF(fetching_salt + PW))*, *SC<sub>PK</sub> = GetPub(SC<sub>SK</sub>)*
 7. *Source* splits any attachment in parts of size `commons.CHUNKS`. Any chunk smaller is padded to `commons.CHUNKS` size.
 8. For every *Chunk*, *<sup>m</sup>u*
    - *Source* generate a random key *<sup>m</sup>s = G()*
    - *Source* encrypts *<sup>m</sup>u* using *<sup>m</sup>s*: *<sup>m</sup>f = E(<sup>m</sup>s, <sup>m</sup>u)*
    - *Source* uploads *<sup>m</sup>f* to *Server*, which returns a random token <sup>m</sup>t (`file_id`)
    - *Server* stores <sup>m</sup>t -> *<sup>m</sup>f* (`file_id` -> `file`)
 9. *Source* adds metadata, *S<sub>PK</sub>*, *SC<sub>PK</sub>* to message *m*.
 10. *Source* adds all the *<sup>[0-m]</sup>s* keys and all the tokens <sup>[0-m]</sup>t (`file_id`) to message *m*
 11. *Source* pads the resulting text to a fixed size: *mp = Pad(message, metadata, S<sub>PK</sub>, SC<sub>PK</sub>, <sup>[0-m]</sup>s, <sup>[0-m]</sup>t)*
 12. For every *Journalist* (i) in *Newsroom* 
     - *Source* generates *<sup>i</sup>ME<sub>SK</sub> = Gen()* (random, per-message secret key)
     - *Source* derives the corresponding public key *<sup>i</sup>ME<sub>PK</sub> = GetPub(<sup>i</sup>ME<sub>SK</sub>)* (`message_public_key`)
     - *Source* derives the shared encryption key using a key-agreement primitive *<sup>i</sup>k = DH(<sup>i</sup>ME<sub>SK</sub>,<sup>i</sup>JE<sub>PK</sub>)*
     - *Source* encrypts *mp* using *<sup>i</sup>k*: *<sup>i</sup>c = Enc(<sup>i</sup>k, mp)* (`message_ciphertext`)
     - *Source* calculates *mgdh = DH(<sup>i</sup>ME<sub>SK</sub>,<sup>i</sup>JC<sub>PK</sub>)* (`message_gdh`)
     - *Source* discards <sup>i</sup>ME<sub>SK</sub> to ensure forward secrecy
     - *Source* sends *(<sup>i</sup>c,<sup>i</sup>ME<sub>PK</sub>,<sup>i</sup>mgdh)* to *Server*
     - *Server* generates *<sup>i</sup>mid = Gen()* (`message_id`) and stores *<sup>i</sup>mid* -> *(<sup>i</sup>c,<sup>i</sup>ME<sub>PK</sub>,<sup>i</sup>mgdh)* (`message_id` -> (`message_ciphertext`, `message_public_key`, `message_gdh`))


### Server message id fetching protocol
 1. For every entry *<sup>i</sup>mid* -> *<sup>i</sup>ME<sub>PK</sub>*, *<sup>i</sup>mgdh* (`message_id` -> (`message_gdh`, `message_public_key`)):
     - *Server* generates per-request, per-message, ephemeral secret key *<sup>i</sup>RE<sub>SK</sub> = Gen()*
     - *Server* calculates *<sup>i</sup>kmid = DH(<sup>i</sup>RE<sub>SK</sub>,<sup>i</sup>mgdh)*
     - *Server* calculates *<sup>i</sup>pmgdh = DH(<sup>i</sup>RE<sub>SK</sub>,<sup>i</sup>ME<sub>PK</sub>)*
     - *Server* encrypts *<sup>i</sup>mid* using *<sup>i</sup>kmid*: *<sup>i</sup>enc_mid = Enc(<sup>i</sup>kmid, <sup>i</sup>mid)*
     - *Server* discards *<sup>i</sup>RE<sub>SK</sub>*
  2. *Server* generates *j = [`commons.MAX_MESSAGES - i`]* random decoys *<sup>[0-j]</sup>decoy_pmgdh* and *<sup>[0-j]</sup>decoy_enc_mid*
  3. *Server* returns a shuffled list of `commons.MAX_MESSAGES` (*i+j*) tuples of *(<sup>[0-i]</sup>pmgdh,<sup>[0-i]</sup>enc_mid) U (<sup>[0-j]</sup>decoy_pmgdh,<sup>[0-j]</sup>enc_mid)*


### Journalist message id fetching protocol
  1. *Source* derives *SC<sub>SK</sub> = G(KDF(fetching_salt + PW))*
  2. *Source* fetches *(<sup>[0-n]</sup>pmgdh,<sup>[0-n]</sup>enc_mid)* from *Server* (`n=commons.MAX_MESSAGES`)
  3. For every *(<sup>n</sup>pmgdh,<sup>n</sup>enc_mid)*:
     - *Source* calculates *<sup>n</sup>kmid = DH(<sup>n</sup>pmgdh,SC<sub>SK</sub>)*
     - *Source* attempts to decrypt *<sup>n</sup>mid = Dec(<sup>n</sup>kmid,<sup>n</sup>enc_mid)*
     - If decryption succeeds, save *<sup>n</sup>mid*

### Source message id fetching protocol
  1. *Journalist* fetches *(<sup>[0-n]</sup>pmgdh,<sup>[0-n]</sup>enc_mid)* from *Server* (`n=commons.MAX_MESSAGES`)
  2. For every *(<sup>n</sup>pmgdh,<sup>n</sup>enc_mid)*:
     - *Journalist* calculates *<sup>n</sup>kmid = DH(<sup>n</sup>pmgdh,JC<sub>SK</sub>)*
     - *Journalist* attempts to decrypt *<sup>n</sup>mid = Dec(<sup>n</sup>kmid,<sup>n</sup>enc_mid)*
     - If decryption succeeds, save *<sup>n</sup>mid*


### Journalist read
 1. *Journalist* fetches from *Server* *mid* -> (*c*, *ME<sub>PK</sub>*) (`message_id` -> (`message_ciphertext`, `message_public_key`))
 2. For every unused  *Journalist* ephemeral key *<sup>i</sup>JE<sub>SK</sub>*
     - *Journalist* calculates a tentative encryption key using the key agreemenet primitive *<sup>i</sup>k = DH(<sup>i</sup>JE<sub>SK</sub>, ME<sub>PK</sub>)*
     - *Journalist* attempts to decrypt *mp = Dec(<sup>i</sup>k, c)*
     - *Journalist* verifies that *mp* decrypted successfully, if yes exits the loop
 3. *Journalist* removes padding from the decrypted message: *(message, metadata, *S<sub>PK</sub>*, *SC<sub>PK</sub>*, *<sup>[0-m]</sup>s*, *<sup>[0-m]</sup>t*) = Unpad(mp)*
 4. For every attachment *Chunk* token *<sup>m</sup>t*
     - *Journalist* fetches from *Server* *<sup>m</sup>t* -> *<sup>m</sup>f* (`file_id` -> `file`)
     - *Journalist* decrypts *<sup>m</sup>f* using *<sup>m</sup>s*: *<sup>m</sup>u = Dec(<sup>m</sup>s, <sup>m</sup>)f*
 5. *Journalist* joins *<sup>m</sup>u* according to metadata and saves back the original files
 6. *Journalist* reads the message *m*

### Journalist reply
 1. *Journalist* has plaintext *mp*, which contains also *S<sub>PK</sub>* and SC<sub>PK</sub>
 2. *Journalist* generates *ME<sub>SK</sub> = Gen()* (random, per-message secret key)
 3. *Journalist* derives the shared encryption key using a key-agreement primitive *k = DH(ME<sub>SK</sub>,S<sub>PK</sub>)*
 4. *Journalist* pads the text to a fixed size: *mp = Pad(message, metadata)* (note: Journalist can potetially attach *<sup>r</sup>JE<sub>PK</sub>,JC<sub>PK</sub>*)
 5. *Journalist* encrypts *mp* using *k*: *c = Enc(k, mp)*
 6. *Journalist* calculates *mgdh = DH(ME<sub>SK</sub>,SC<sub>PK</sub>)* (`message_gdh`)
 7. *Journalist* discards *ME<sub>SK</sub>*
 8. *Journalist* sends *(c,ME<sub>PK</sub>,mgdh)* to *Server*
 9. *Server* generates *mid = Gen()* (`message_id`) and stores *mid* -> *(c,ME<sub>PK</sub>,mgdh)* (`message_id` -> (`message_ciphertext`, `message_public_key`, `message_gdh`))

### Source read
 1. *Source* fetches from *Server* *mid* -> (*c*, *ME<sub>PK</sub>*) (`message_id` -> (`message_ciphertext`, `message_public_key`))
 2. *Source* derives *S<sub>SK</sub> = G(KDF(encryption_salt + PW))*
 3. *Source* calculates the shared encryption key using a key agreement protocol *k = DH(S<sub>SK</sub>, ME<sub>PK</sub>)*
 4. *Source* decrypts the message using *k*: *mp = Dec(k<sup>k</sup>, c)*
 5. *Source* removes padding from the decrypted message: *m = Unpad(mp)*
 6. *Source* reads the message and the metadata

### Source reply
*Source* replies work the exact same way as a first submission, except the source is already known to the *Journalist*. As an additional difference, a *Journalist* might choose to attach his (and eventually others) keys in the reply, so that *Source* does not have to fetch those from the server as in a first submission.

### Flow Chart

![chart](https://github.com/lsd-cat/securedrop-poc/blob/main/imgs/sd_schema.png?raw=true)

For simplicity, in this chart, messages are sent to a single *Journalist* rather than to all journalists enrolled with a given newsroom, and the attachment submission and retrieval procedure is omitted.

Observe the asymmetry in the client-side operations:

| Routine | Journalist fetch and decrypt | Source fetch and decrypt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Leg** | **message_ciphertext,ME<sub>PK</sub>** | **message_ciphertext,ME<sub>PK</sub>** |
| Step 1. | k = DH(ME<sub>PK</sub>,<sup>i</sup>JE<sub>SK</sub>) | k = DH(ME<sub>PK</sub>,S<sub>SK</sub>) |
| Step 2. | Discard(<sup>i</sup>JE<sub>SK</sub>) |
| Step 3. | S<sub>PK</sub>,SC<sub>PK</sub>,m = Dec(k,message_ciphertext) | <sup>m</sup>JE<sub>PK</sub>,JC<sub>PK</sub>,m = Dec(k,message_ciphertext) |

## Server endpoints

No endpoints require authentication or sessions. The only data store is Redis and is schema-less. Encrypted file chunks are stored to disk. No database bootstrap is required.

### /journalists

**Legend**:

| JSON Name | Value |
|---|---|
|`count` | Number of returned enrolled *Journalists* |
|`journalist_key` | *base64(J<sub>PK</sub>)* |
|`journalist_sig` | *base64(sig<sup>NR</sup>(J<sub>PK</sub>))* |
|`journalist_fetching_key` | *base64(JC<sub>PK</sub>)* |
|`journalist_fetching_sig` | *base64(sig<sup>J</sup>(JC<sub>PK</sub>))* |
|`journalist_uid` | *hex(Hash(J<sub>PK</sub>))* |

#### POST
Adds *Newsroom* signed *Journalist* to the *Server*.
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://127.0.0.1:5000/journalists" --data
{
    "journalist_key": <journalist_key>,
    "journalist_sig": <journalist_sig>,
    "journalist_fetching_key": <journalist_fetching_key>,
    "journalist_fetching_sig": <journalist_fetching_sig>
}
```
```
200 OK
```

The server checks for proper signature using *NR<sub>PK</sub>*. If both signatures are valid, the request fields are added to the `journalists` Redis *set*.

#### GET
Gets the journalists enrolled in *Newsroom* and published in the *Server*.
The *Journalist* UID is a hex encoded hash of the Journalist long-term signing key.

```
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:5000/journalists"
```
```
200 OK
{
  "count": <count>,
  "journalists": [
    {
      "journalist_fetching_key": <journalist_fetching_key>,
      "journalist_fetching_sig": <journalist_fetching_sig>,
      "journalist_key": <journalist_key>,
      "journalist_sig": <journalist_sig>,
      "journalist_uid": <journalist_uid>
    },
    ...
  ],
  "status": "OK"
}
```

At this point *Source* must have a verified *NR<sub>PK</sub>* and must verify both *sig<sub>J</sub>* and *sig<sub>JC</sub>*.

#### DELETE (TODO)
*Not implemented yet. A Newsroom must be able to remove Journalists.*

### /ephemeral_keys

**Legend**:

| JSON Name | Value |
|---|---|
|`count` | Number of returned ephemeral keys. It should match the number of *Journalists*. If it does not, a specific *Journalist* bucket might be out of keys. |
|`ephemeral_key` | *base64(JE<sub>PK</sub>)* |
|`ephemeral_sig` | *base64(sig<sup>J</sup>(JE<sub>PK</sub>))* |
|`journalist_uid` | *hex(Hash(J<sub>PK</sub>))* |


#### POST
Adds *n* *Journalist* signed ephemeral key agreement keys to Server.
The keys are stored in a Redis *set* specific per *Journalist*, which key is `journalist:<journalist_uid>`. In the demo implementation, the number of ephemeral keys to generate and upload each time is `commons.ONETIMEKEYS`. 

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://127.0.0.1:5000/ephemeral_keys" --data
{
  "journalist_uid": <journalist_uid>,
  "ephemeral_keys": [
    {
      "ephemeral_key": <ephemeral_key>,  
      "epheneral_sig": <ephemeral_sig>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
```
200 OK
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```
#### GET
The server pops a random ephemeral_key from every enrolled journalist bucket and returns it. The `pop` operation effectively removes the returned keys from the corresponding *Journalist* bucket.
```
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/ephemeral_keys
```
```
200 OK
{
  "count": <count>,
  "ephemeral_keys": [
    {
      "ephemeral_key": <ephemeral_key>,
      "ephemeral_sig": <ephemeral_sig>,
      "journalist_uid": <journalist_uid>
    },
    ...
  ],
  "status": "OK"
}
```
At this point *Source* must have verified all the J<sup>[0-i]</sup><sub>PK</sub>*  and can thus verify all the corresponding *sig<sup>[0-n]</sup><sub>JE</sub>*.

#### DELETE (TODO)
*Not implemented yet. A Journalist shall be able to revoke keys from the server.*

### /fetch

**Legend**:

| JSON Name | Value |
|---|---|
|`count` | Number of returned potential messages. Must always be greater than the number of messages on the server. Equal to `commons.MAX_MESSAGES` so that it should always be the same for every request to prevent leaking the number of messages on the server. |
|`messages` | *(base64(pmgdh),base64(enc_mid))* |

#### GET
The server sends all the mixed group Diffie Hellman shares, plus the encrypted message id of the corresponding messsage. *gdh* and *enc* are paired in couples.

```
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/fetch
```
```
200 OK
{
  "count": <commons.MAX_MESSAGES>,
  "messages": [
     {
       "gdh": <share_for_group_DH1>,
       "enc": <encrypted_message_id1>,
     },
     {
       "gdh": <share_for_group_DH2>,
       "enc": <encrypted_message_id2>,
     }
    ...
    <commons.MAX_MESSAGES>
    ],
  "status": "OK"
}
```
### /message/[message_id]

**Legend**:

| JSON Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `message_id` | Randomly generated unique, per message id. |
|`message_ciphertext` | *base64(Enc(k, m))* where *k* is a key agreement calculated key. The key agreement keys depend on the parties encrypting/decrypting the message. |
|`message_public_key` | *base64(ME<sub>PK</sub>)* |
|`message_gdh` | *base64(ME<sub>SK</sub>,SC/JC<sub>PK</sub>)* |

#### POST
```
curl -X POST -H "Content_Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:5000/message --data
{
  "message_ciphertext": <message_ciphertext>,
  "message_public_key": <message_public_key>,
  "message_gdh": <message_gdhe>
}
```
```
200 OK
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```

Note that `message_id` is not returned upon submission, so that the sending party cannot delete or fetch it unless they maliciously craft the `message_gdh` for themselves, but at that point it would never be delivered to any other party.

#### GET
`message_public_key` is necessary for completing the key agreement protocol and obtaining the shared symmetric key to decrypt the message. `message_public_key`, is ephemeral, unique per message, and has no links to anything else.

```
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/message/<message_id>
```
```
200 OK
{
  "message": {
    "message_ciphertext": <message_ciphertext>,
    "message_public_key": <message_public_key>
  },
  "status": "OK"
}
```

#### DELETE

```
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/message/<message_id>
```
```
200 OK
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```

### /file/[file_id]
Slicing and encrypting is up to the *Source* client. The server cannot enforce encryption, but it can enforce equal chunk size (TODO: not implemented).

**Legend**:

| JSON Name | Value |
|---|---|
|`file_id` | Unique, randomly generated per upload id. Files are sliced, paded and encrypted to a fixed size so that all files looks equal and there are no metadata, however that is up to the uploading client. |
| `raw_encrypted_file_content` | Raw bytes composing the encrypted file object. |

#### POST
The `file_id` is secret, meaning that any parties with knowledge of it can either download the encrypted chunk or delete it. In production, it could be possible to set `commons.UPLOADS` to a FUSE filesystem without timestamps.

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/file -F <path_to_encrypted_chunk>
```
```
200 OK
{
  "file_id": <file_id>,
  "status": "OK"
}
```

#### GET
The server will return either the raw encrypted content or a `404` status code.
```
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/file/<message_id>
```
```
200 OK
<raw_encrypted_file_content>
```
#### DELETE
A delete request deletes both the entry in the database and the encrypted chunk stored on the server.
```
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/file/<file_id>
```
```
200 OK
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```

## Limitations and Discussion
### Crypto
The cryptographic protocol needs to be audited.
  
### Behavioral analysis
While there are no user accounts, and all messages have the same structure from an HTTP perspective, the server could still detect if it were interacting with a source or a journalist by observing API request patterns. Both source and journalist traffic would go through the Tor network, but they might perform different actions (such as uploading ephemeral keys). A further fingerprinting mechanism could be, for instance, measuring how much time any client takes to fetch messages. Mitigations, such as sending decoy traffic or introducing randomness between requests, must be implemented in the client.

### Ephemeral key exhaustion
A known problem with this type of protocol is the issue of ephemeral key exhaustion, either by an adversary or due to infrequent journalist activity.

### Ephemeral key reuse (malicious server)
Attempts by a malicious server to reuse ephemeral keys will need to be detected and mitigated.
Key expiration is not currently implemented, but ephemeral keys could include a short (30/60 day) expiration date along with their PK signature. Journalists can routinely query the server for ephemeral keys and heuristically test if the server is being dishonest as well. They can also check during decryption as well and see if an already used key has worked: in that case the server is malicious as well.

### Decoy traffic
One mitigation for behavioural analysis is the introduction of decoy traffic, which is readily compatible with this protocol. Since all messages and all submissions are structurally indistinguishable from a server perspective, as are all fetching operations, and there is no state or cookies involved between requests, any party on the internet could produce decoy traffic on any instance. Newsrooms, journalists or even FPF could produce all the required traffic just from a single machine.

### Message retention
The computation required for the message-fetching portion of this protocol limits the number of messages that can be stored on the server at once (a current estimate is that more than a few thousand would produce unreasonably slow computation times). Messages either need to be deleted upon receipt or to automatically expire after a reasonable interval. If implementing automatic message expiry, the expiration should have a degree of randomness, in order to avoid leaking metadata that could function as a form of timestamp.

### Denial of service
Without traditional accounts, it might be easy to flood the service with unwanted messages or fetching requests that would be heavy on the server CPU. Depending on the individual *Newsroom* previous issues and threat model, classic rate-limiting techniques such as proof of work or captchas (even though we truly dislike them) could mitigate the issue.

### Minimize logging
To minimize logging, and mix traffic better, it could be reasonable to make all endpoints the same and POST only and remove all GET parameters. An alternative solution could be to implement the full protocol over WebSockets.

### Revocation
Revocation is a spicy topic. For ephemeral keys, we expect key expiration to be a sufficient measure. For long-term keys, it will be necessary to implement the infrastructure to support journalist de-enrollment and newsroom key rotation. For example, FPF could routinely publish a revocation list and host Newsroom revocation lists as well; however, a key design constraint is to ensure that the entire SecureDrop system can be set up autonomously, and function even without FPF's direct involvement. A good existing protocol for serving the revocation would be OCSP stapling served back directly by the SecureDrop server, so that clients (both sources and journalists) do not have to perform external requests. Otherwise we could find a way to (ab)use the current internet revocation infrastructure and build on top of that.

### More hardening
This protocol can be hardened further in specific parts, including: rotating fetching keys regularly on the journalist side; adding a short (e.g., 30 day) expiration to ephemeral keys so that they are guaranteed to rotate even in case of malicious servers; and allowing for "submit-only" sources that do not save the passphrase and are not reachable after first contact. These details are left for internal team evaluation and production implementation constraints.

### Diffie-Hellman usage in the PoC
In the code in this repository, depending on the case, sometimes the key agreement multiplication is done manually, sometimes `python-ecdsa` `generate_sharedsecret_bytes()` is invoked. In both cases, [according to libsodium documentation](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/scalar_multiplication), the output should be hashed in certain ways to prevent a set of attacks. Besides the key-agreemet for encryption, we have yet to understand how this can affect the Group Diffie-Hellman, since we cannot hash partial results.
