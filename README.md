## Status

> [!WARNING]
> This is proof-of-concept code and is not intended for production use. The protocol details are not yet finalized.

**January 2025:** A formal analysis was performed by
[Luca Maier](https://github.com/lumaier) in
<https://github.com/lumaier/securedrop-formalanalysis> and published as ["A
Formal Analysis of the SecureDrop
Protocol"](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000718325), supervised by David Basin,
Felix Linker, and Shannon Veitch in the Information Security Group at ETH
Zürich.

**December 2023:** A preliminary cryptographic audit was performed by
[Michele Orrù](https://github.com/mmaker). See
<https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/issues/36>.

## Background

To better understand the context of this research and the previous steps that led to it, read the following blog posts:

- [Part 1: Future directions for SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/news/future-directions-for-securedrop/)
- [Part 2: Anatomy of a whistleblowing system](https://securedrop.org/news/anatomy-of-a-whistleblowing-system/)
- [Part 3: How to research your own cryptography and survive](https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/)
- [Part 4: Introducing SecureDrop Protocol](https://securedrop.org/news/introducing-securedrop-protocol/)

## Repository overview

The code in this repository implements three components:

- a server, which can process encrypted messages and attachments
- a source client, which can encrypt and send messages and attachments, and which can receive and decrypt messages
- a journalist client, which can receive and decrypt messages and attachments, and which can encrypt and send messages

In this proof-of-concept implementation, the components are not fully separated; for example, `commons.py` includes code and configuration shared between all components.

Data is persisted in the following ways:

- Journalist key material generated by `pki.py` is stored on-disk under `cryptokeys/`. It is accessed there by the journalist client, which uploads public keys to the server
- The server uses Redis as a key/value store to persist the following:
  - for each journalist: long-term signing public key, long-term message-fetching public key, ephemeral public keys, and signatures for all keys
  - for each message: ciphertext, per-message public key, and per-message group Diffie Hellman share
  - for each attachment: the randomly generated filename of the on-disk binary ciphertext
- Binary ciphertexts of attachments uploaded by sources are stored by the server on-disk under `files/`
- Messages downloaded and decrypted by journalists are persisted in an SQLite3 database, which is stored in the `files/` directory
- Attachments downloaded and decrypted by journalists are stored on-disk under `downloads/`

See the [documentation](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/tree/main/docs) for the protocol's architecture, threat model, and specification.

Another PoC server implementation in Lua is available in the [securedrop-protocol-server-resty](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol-server-resty) repository.

## Installation (Fedora)

Install dependencies and create the virtual environment.

```
sudo dnf install redis
sudo systemctl start redis
python3 -m virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate the FPF root key, the intermediate key, and the journalists' long term keys, and sign them all hierarchically.

```
python3 pki.py
```

Run the server:

```
FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask --app server run
```

Impersonate the journalists and generate ephemeral keys for each of them. Upload all the public keys and their signature to the server.

```
for i in $(seq 0 9); do python3 journalist.py -j $i -a upload_keys; done;
```

Call/caller charts can be generated with `make docs`.

## Config

In `commons.py` there are the following configuration values which are global for all components, even though not all parties need all of them.

| Variable       | Value            | Components                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SERVER`       | `127.0.0.1:5000` | source, journalist         | The URL the Flask server listens on; used by both the journalist and the source clients.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `DIR`          | `cryptokeys/`    | server, source, journalist | The folder where everybody will load the keys from. There is no separation for demo simplicity but in an actual implementation everybody will only have their keys and the required public one to ensure the trust chain.                           |
| `UPLOADS`      | `files/`         | server                     | The folder where the Flask server will store uploaded files                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `JOURNALISTS`  | `10`             | server, source             | How many journalists do we create and enroll. In general, this is realistic; in current SecureDrop usage it is typically a smaller number. For demo purposes everybody knows this, in a real scenario it would not be needed.                       |
| `ONETIMEKEYS`  | `30`             | journalist                 | How many ephemeral keys each journalist creates, signs and uploads when required.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `MAX_MESSAGES` | `500`            | server                     | How many potential messages the server sends to each party when they try to fetch messages. This basically must be more than the messages in the database, otherwise we need to develop a mechanism to group messages adding some bits of metadata. |
| `CHUNK`        | `512 * 1024`     | source                     | The base size of every part which attachments are split into or padded to. This is not the actual size on disk; that will be a bit larger depending on the nacl SecretBox implementation.                                                           |

The following parameters are not currently configurable or used but should be in
a production implementation:

| Variable                                | Value  | Components | Description                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SOURCE_PASSPHRASE_DICTIONARY_MIN_SIZE` | `7300` | components | Require that `DICTIONARY_SIZE >= SOURCE_PASSPHRASE_DICTIONARY_MIN_SIZE`. [Inherited from current SecureDrop.][passphrases.py] |
| `SOURCE_PASSPHRASE_ENTROPY_MIN_BITS`    | `89`   | source     | Target for $\texttt{SOURCE\\_PASSPHRASE\\_WORDS\\_NUM} \times \log_2(\texttt{DICTIONARY\\_SIZE})$.                            |
| `SOURCE_PASSPHRASE_WORDS_NUM`           | `7`    | source     | [Inherited from current SecureDrop.][passphrases.py]                                                                          |

## Demo

```
bash demo.sh
```

The demo script will clean past keys and files, flush Redis, generate a new PKI, start the server, generate and upload journalists and simulate submissions and replies from different sources/journalists.
