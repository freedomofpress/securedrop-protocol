## What is this?

This is a manual fork of
<https://gist.github.com/cfm/dab18074b9cecb06cbd006e1ab7ede7f> plus a KEM.  The
goal to keep this in sync on top of
<https://gist.github.com/cfm/dab18074b9cecb06cbd006e1ab7ede7f> so that a diff
shows *only* KEM-related changes.

```sh-session
$ git clone git@gist.github.com:09f4e5682d3b216762cd878e3a8879f0.git dhetm-kem-securedrop
$ cd dhetm-kem-securedrop/
$ git remote add upstream git@gist.github.com:dab18074b9cecb06cbd006e1ab7ede7f.git
$ git fetch upstream
$ git diff upstream/main
```


## What are we trying to do?

Out of the IETF's Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG), ["Combiner Functions for
Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanisms"][draft-ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners] tells
us that

> [t]he need for a KEM combiner function arises in three different contexts
> within IETF security protocols:  (1) [...]; (2) Post-quantum / traditional
> hybrid KEMs where output of a post-quantum KEM is combined with the output of
> a classical key transport or key exchange algorithm.  [...][^1]

The Post-Quantum Use in Protocols Working Group (PQUIP)'s ["Terminology for
Post-Quantum Traditional Hybrid
Schemes"][draft-ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology] gives us the relevant
definitions:

> **Post-Quantum Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrid Scheme:**  A multi-algorithm scheme
> where at least one component algorithm is a post-quantum algorithm and at
> least one is a traditional algorithm.[^2]
>
> **PQ/T Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM):**  A multi-algorithm KEM
> made up of two or more component algorithms where at least one is a
> post-quantum algorithm and at least one is a traditional algorithm. The
> component algorithms could be KEMs, or other key establishment
> algorithms.[^3]

This is important.  We are not merely *adding* a KEM *to* DHETM (a non-KEM key
exchange).  We are effectively transforming DHETM *into* a KEM.

And then "Combiner Functions" gives us the general principle of what we're
doing here:

> A KEM combiner is a function that takes in two or more shared secrets `ss_i`
> and returns a combined shared secret `ss`.
>
>     ss = kemCombiner(ss_1, ss_2, ..., ss_n)
>
> This document assumes that shared secrets are the output of a KEM, but
> without loss of generality they MAY also be any other source of cryptographic
> key material [...].[^4]

In our case, we'll have something like:

```python
ss_1 = DH(...)
ss_2 = DH(...)
ss_3, ct = Encap()  # ct to be dealt with separately
ss = kemCombiner(ss_1, ss_2, ss_3)
```

"Combiner Functions" gives more [guidance][kem-combiner-construction] on how
`kemCombiner()` should be implemented.  Specifically, `kemCombiner()` needs to
be a "split" or "dual" pseudo-random function (PRF).[^5]  For the purpose of
prototyping here, we'll continue to use `kemCombiner() = nacl.hashlib.scrypt()`
and leave open (below) the question of what KDF should be used in
`kemCombiner()`.

## Open questions for real-world use

1. What KDF should be used in `kemCombiner()`?
    1. Is (e.g.) `nacl.hashlib.scrypt()` a dual/split PRF?
    2. Do we need to specifically prove the IND-CCA2 requirement discussed in the ["Security Considerations" section of "KEM Combiners"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners-05#name-security-considerations)?[^6]

    > NIST notes that ML-KEM outputs a shared secret key which can be interpreted as a shared secret (in the terminology of SP 800-56C) that **does not require** further key derivation.  However, further key derivation is allowed. One situation where this may be desired is for the purpose of combining an ML-KEM shared secret key with another shared secret.  NIST also notes that security of ML-KEM against an active adversary may or may not apply once an ML-KEM key is combined with another shared secret.  NIST intends to offer guidance on various key combiners in the forthcoming NIST SP 800-227.
